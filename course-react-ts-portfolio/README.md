Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project

## Highlights

- Overview of typescript
- Assumes node is installed. I used nvm (node verion manager).
- Before you start, install typescript and ts-node `npm install -g typescript ts-node`

## What did I learn?

- I learned typescript on the job at Imperfect Foods. This course served as a refresher on typescript and I learned a few new language features.
- I have extensive experience with webpack, and it was good to work with esbuild in the jbook project and parcel in the maps project.
- The jbook project is based on lerna and included some fun challenges that I hadn't explored extensively (in-browser bundling, communication with an iframe).
